# CocoonJS Command Line tools #

The CocoonJS command line tools let you build Cordova-based applications that benefit of the performance [Webview+](http://support.ludei.com/hc/en-us/articles/201952993).The main goal of the CocoonJS CLI is to provide the Ludei services (like cloud project management) right in you terminal.


> The Webview+ provide you a consistent rendering engine independently of the Android 4.x version, so your app/game will run using the same rendering engine, with the fastest javascript engine in the world (V8).

## Requirements ##
Please refer to the [Cordova requirements](https://github.com/apache/cordova-cli#requirements) in order to set up the requirements.

After installing Cordova in your computer, execute the following command to install the CocoonJS CLI tools:

```
$ npm install -g cocoonjs
```

## How to use ##

Use any valid cordova command with the CocoonJS-CLI to manage your project, eg:

```
$ cocoonjs create /path/ com.ludei.test LudeiTest
$ cocoonjs platform add android
$ cocoonjs plugin add com.ludei.webview.plus
$ cocoonjs build
$ cocoonjs run
```

CocoonJS Cloud project managment
There is a command reserved to handle CocoonJS cloud based projects (http://cloud.ludei.com), the command is called "cloud" and can be used as follows:
```
$ cocoonjs cloud
```

This command *is still* in development and should be avoid its usage for now.

### FAQ ###

#### Â¿Which version of cordova is required? ####
The CocoonJS command line tool automatically detects the Cordova version that you've installed in your computer, however, if you use a different cordova version that you've installed locally, you can use the --cordova-path argument to tell the CocoonJS-CLI where is the cordova binary that is need to be used for the cordova commands, eg:


```
$ cocoonjs platform add android --cordova-path=/Users/Cocoon/cordova/cordova-3.5.0-0.2.4/
```
When using the *--cordova-path* the CocoonJS-CLI will find the cordova binary inside *cordova-3.5.0-0.2.4/bin/cordova* and will use it to spawn all the cordova based commands, you can use any cordova 3.x version.
